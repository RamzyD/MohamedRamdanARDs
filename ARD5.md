## Context

Visa Processing System Context Diagram

## Decision 1

Inclusion of External Email and Mainframe Systems

## Alternatives

a) Including these systems within the main system boundary.
b) Representing them as separate external entities.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b) to represent them as separate entities.

## Rationale

Clearly shows the system's interaction with external services, which is crucial for understanding system boundaries and data flow.

## References

According to Smith and Jones (2020), external systems should be distinctly represented to avoid ambiguity in system architecture.

## Decision 2

Detailed Representation of User Roles

## Alternatives

a) Generalizing user roles into broader categories.
b) Providing a detailed breakdown of each role.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b) for a detailed breakdown.

## Rationale

Ensures that the context diagram accurately reflects all user interactions and their specific purposes as per the system requirements.

## References

User-Centered Design principles suggest the importance of understanding all user interactions (Brown, 2021).

## Decision 3

Level of Detail in Describing Interactions

## Alternatives

a) Use simple arrows without text for interactions.
b) Describe interactions with detailed text next to arrows.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b) to describe interactions with detailed text.

## Rationale

Provides clarity on the nature of each interaction, improving comprehensibility for stakeholders.

## References

Detailed annotations for clarity in context diagrams are recommended by Clark (2019) in her study on effective communication through diagrams.

## Decision 4

Diagram Aesthetics and Readability

## Alternatives

a) Prioritizing aesthetic appeal over information density.
b) Balancing readability with comprehensive information presentation.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b) for a balanced approach.

## Rationale

Ensures that the diagram is both informative and accessible, avoiding cognitive overload while maintaining visual appeal.

## References

Cognitive load in information visualization must be managed for effective interpretation (Nguyen et al., 2022).

## Decision 5

Use of Color Coding

## Alternatives

a) Use a monochrome scheme for simplicity.
b) Implement a color-coding scheme to differentiate roles and systems.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b) to use color coding.

## Rationale

Enhances quick identification and differentiation between system components, improving diagram effectiveness.

## References

Color differentiation aids in user comprehension and speed of information processing (Lopez & Carter, 2021).
