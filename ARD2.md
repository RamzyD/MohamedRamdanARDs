## Context

Visa Processing System Code Diagram

## Decision 1

Use of Facade Design Pattern

## Alternatives:

a) Direct interaction between client code and subsystems.
b) Use of a facade to provide a simplified interface to the subsystems.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b), implementing MainframeVisaSystemFacade.

## Rationale

Reduces complexity of the system's interface, promotes loose coupling, and
improves code maintainability.

## Decision 2

Exception Handling Strategy

## Alternatives

a) Use generic exceptions for all error handling.
b) Create specific exceptions for the system, such as VisaSystemException.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b).

## Rationale

Provides more granular error handling, allowing for better client-side decision making based on specific exception types.

## Decision 3

Representation of Request and Response Objects

## Alternatives

a) Use primitive data types for request and response data.
b) Use object-oriented VisaApplicationRequest and VisaApplicationResponse classes.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b).

## Rationale

Encapsulates request and response data, providing a flexible structure that can be easily extended or modified.

## Decision 4

Abstract Classes for Request and Response

## Alternatives

a) Duplicate common properties and methods in all request and response classes.
b) Abstract commonalities into AbstractRequest and AbstractResponse base classes.

## Decision

Chose alternative (b).

## Rationale

Encourages code reuse and reduces duplication, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Decision 5

Integration with External E-mail and Mainframe Systems

## Alternatives:

a) Building custom solutions for email and mainframe interactions.
b) Integrating with existing enterprise-level systems (e.g., Microsoft Exchange).

## Decision

Chose alternative (b).

## Rationale

Leverages stable, well-supported platforms for critical system functionality, reducing development time and increasing reliability.
